# Zero-Trust Configuration Questionnaire (Full AVM Inputs)

This questionnaire lists **every input** exposed by the AVM modules used by the App-AKS landing zone.
It is aligned to a zero-trust baseline:

- Private networking is required. Inputs that control public access are marked as **Fixed**.
- Centralized logging/monitoring is required. Diagnostic settings inputs are marked as **Fixed**.
- Telemetry is disabled for all modules. `enable_telemetry` is marked as **Fixed** and set to `false`.
- Provide values for all other inputs as needed. Leave blank if you want module defaults.

For each module:

- The current demo module block from `main.tf` is included (if present).
- A full input list follows, with explanations from the module itself.
- A placeholder section for additional log/metric details is provided.

Updating the cluster with the same <major.minor> once it has been created (e.g. 1.14.x -> 1.14) will not trigger an upgrade, even if a newer patch version is available. As a best practice, you should upgrade all node pools in an AKS cluster to the same Kubernetes version. The node pool version must have the same major version as the control plane. The node pool minor version must be within two minor versions of the control plane version. The node pool version cannot be greater than the control plane version.
